// The link (DESIGN §6): what the runtime (src/runtime) and the extension backend
// (src/extension/backend) say to each other. The runtime is a client of Lumiverse like any other: it
// signs in as the user, finds the extension, opens the event socket as a widget session and sends
// the requests below as SPINDLE_BACKEND_MSG frames. Each is answered by its `id` with exactly one
// `result` or `error` frame, sent to the runtime's own session (`sendToFrontend(…, { frontendSessionId })`).
// The extension pushes to that session too: a stream's chunks, a turn to stop, settings that changed,
// a relay secret rotated, a loopback connection to make.
//
// Rules both ends keep:
// - Every frame carries `link: LINK`, so neither end mistakes it for the frontend's messages
//   (src/shared/ui.ts), which travel the same channel.
// - Every request but `register` carries the relay's secret. The extension refuses one without a
//   valid secret (`forbidden`), and takes the frame's session as where that runtime's pushes go
//   from then on, so a runtime that reconnected is found on its new session. A `register` may show
//   the secret its runtime already holds: it then keeps the registration and binds no session.
// - `hello` says the link version both ways; a mismatch is refused in words that name which side
//   to update (`versionWords`).
// - A stream (a tool's run in the extension, a tool call held for the user's word) is named by the
//   runtime before it asks, so no chunk can arrive for a stream it doesn't know. It carries one
//   chunk, its outcome (`value` or `error`), numbered 1; the extension keeps it until the runtime
//   acknowledges it, and sends it again to a runtime that reconnected (stream.ts).
// - A runtime carries only its own account's turns: a loopback key or a turn's tag of another user
//   is refused.
// - A frame too large for Lumiverse's socket crosses in parts (parts.ts), either way.
// - The reads and writes of the core's ports (`blob.*`, `doc.*`, `chat.*`, `lore.*`, `preset.*`,
//   `trace.push`, `recall.*`, `book.read`) carry the ports' own shapes (src/core/ports.ts,
//   src/core/recall/ports.ts), so the two can't drift apart. The core's model calls and connections
//   are the runtime's own (runtime/models): none of them crosses the link.
// - A notice is what the runtime tells the extension without waiting for an answer: a model's
//   answer as it arrives, for the live view. It has no id and no secret. The extension takes one
//   only from a session a hello bound to a runtime, in the order they were sent; one that is lost
//   is not sent again.
