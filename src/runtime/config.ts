// credential) and its relay secret. `up` writes it; `serve` reads it, and reads its session again
// whenever the link opens, so `lumiah login` takes effect without a restart. Its `tuning` is the
// runtime's limits and timings as it last read them from the user's settings: what it starts with
// before it has linked. Beside what the runtime runs with, it keeps how the runtime was set up and
// is kept: its memory limit, whether it updates itself, the file it was set up from, and the unit
// that runs it. And here is where a runtime keeps its data: its data folder and its own folder there.
