// What both ends read of Lumiverse's chats and world books (PI-BUILD-PLAN §4.5): the rows the
// extension's host gives (spindle.ts makes them from Spindle's answers), and the reads of them the
// shared logic in this folder runs over. The extension's backend reads them through Spindle; the
// runtime through its copy of chat and lore (runtime/copy/), which gives the very same rows, and over
// the link wherever the copy can't vouch for one.
//
// Nothing in this folder reaches Spindle, the filesystem, a socket or a model's library: the
// extension's backend bundles it, and Lumiverse refuses a backend that does.
