// What the lore and history tools read from the host beyond `LorePort` and `ChatPort` (DESIGN §24):
// every lore entry with its state, how Lumiverse activated what it put in the prompt, when each chat
// message was sent, embeddings on the user's embedding connection, Lumiverse's Memory Cortex, the
// user's databanks and their web search provider.
//
// Every member is optional, so a host written before them still fits. Without `lore` the tools read
// the books through `LorePort` and know less of each entry; without `chat` no message has a date;
// without `embeddings` search is by word; and a host without `memory`, `databanks` or `web` means
// the tools that rest on it are not offered. Lumiverse is the data surface: nothing here keeps a
// copy of what Lumiverse keeps.
