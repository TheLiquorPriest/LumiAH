// What counts as a chat's story (DESIGN §24.4): which of its messages the agents read as the story.
// The reply is not the source of truth, and neither is every message: the user says what the story
// is made of, and the agents read that and nothing else.
//
// Three choices, each the user's (in Settings, and for one chat), or the extension's that answers
// a chat where it says so:
// - `hidden`: a message the user hid from the prompt in Lumiverse is left out, or read like any other;
// - `from`: whose messages are the story: everyone's, or only the model's replies, the user's being
//   directions from outside the story (Lumiverse's Sovereign Hand). `lumiverse` follows Lumiverse's
//   own switch, where Lumiverse says how it stands;
// - `newest`: with only the replies, the user's newest message is given to the main agent as the
//   direction for the reply, or left out too (the preset carries it).
//
// Each member resolves on its own, strongest word first: the claiming extension's, the chat's own
// choice, the user's setting. A message left out is never listed, searched, matched, returned or
// embedded, and an answer says how many were and why; its number stays the chat's own, and a
// citation of it still checks, since citations hash against the whole chat.
